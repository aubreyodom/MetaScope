#' Helper function to remove reads matched to filter libraries
#'
#' Within the \code{filter_host()} function, we align our sequencing sample to all
#' filter libraries of interest. The \code{remove_matches()} function allows
#' for removal of any target reads that are also aligned to filter libraries.
#'
#' This function is not intended for use by users.
#'
#' @param reads_bam The name of a merged, sorted .bam file that has previously
#' been aligned to a reference library. Likely, the output from running an
#' instance of \code{align_target()}.
#' @param read_names A \code{list} of target query names from \code{reads_bam}
#' that have also aligned to a filter reference library. Each \code{list}
#' element should be a vector of read names.
#' @param name_out The name of the .bam file that to which the filtered alignments
#' will be written.
#'
#' @return The name of a filtered, sorted .bam file written to the user's
#' current working directory.
